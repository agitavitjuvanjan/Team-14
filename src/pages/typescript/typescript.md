### JavaScript that scales. 
>TypeScript is a typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JS. Any browser or OS  - is open source.

By using TypeScript instead of native JavaScript you get the compile time checking, similar to C# (like using correct types, names etc...).

TypeScript also contains features of ECMAScript 6, like classes, lambda functions, let (better than var),... which can be compiled to older ECMAScript (using prototype, functions, var,...)

###Code Example
```TypeScript
greet({
  greeting: "hello world",
  duration: 4000
});
```
